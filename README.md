# Color Wheel Clock

A program in the [Wiring](http://wiring.org.co/reference/) language for the [Spark Core](https://www.spark.io/) that displays the time as a color. How does this work? Think about the color wheel we all learned in elementary school. Including primary, secondary, and tertiary colors there are 12 spots around the wheel. If each one of those is represented by a color, we have a 12 hour clock ready to go.

Now, obviously, this is not precise by any means. Rather, it expands upon my earlier experiments with conveying specific, easily quantified information in a nebulous, ambient way.
